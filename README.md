# Early Speed Breaker Detection

### Working of the project
- Collect sensor data from smartphone will going over speedbreaker (data is in combined_data.xlsx)
- Train an ML Model to classify speed breakers and non speed breakers
- Create a webapp that runs in the background and collects sensor data and geolocation data and sends it to server
- The server saves the information after validating it 
- The user can use our service by opening a link and will be alerted if there is an upcoming speedbreaker
